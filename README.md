## TL;DR

This repository contains my proposal for, and notes from the [DEWT6 Peer Conference](https://dewt.wordpress.com/category/dewt6/).

## #dailyDEWT

For up to two weeks after the DEWT6 Peer Conference, I have a daily tweet from my notes.

To see them all, see the [#dailyDEWT hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23dailyDEWT) or [the #dailyDEWT page here](/DEWT6/daily-tweet/).

## Introduction

Through the good grace of the gods (and some very nice mortals), I found myself invited to the most excellent [sixth annual peer conference of the Dutch Exploratory Workshop on Testing (DEWT6)](https://dewt.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/dewt6-announced-communicating-testing-during-software-development/), taking place from Friday 22 January till Sunday 24 January 2016.

For those less familiar with the concept of a peer converence, if I had to explain in one sentence it would be this: 

**Instead of one person speaking and everybody else listening, it is about exchange and communication between _all_ participant in equal measure.**

To quote from the website:

> The peer conferences of the Dutch Exploratory Workshop on Testing are based on the experience reports of the participants. Therefore each participant is asked to prepare an experience report on the conference theme. Participation in this conference is by invitation only.

What is not stated, is that the DEWT conference is an _priceless_ experience. 

## The previous time

I was priviliged enough to be allowed to attend the previous [DEWT peer conference (DEWT5)](https://dewt.wordpress.com/2015/01/19/dewt5-report/). The  central theme of the 2015 peer conference was **Test Strategy**.

I took so many notes, had so many impressions, idea's and discussion that I still hadn't managed to parse all of it it a year later.

## This time

The theme of the 2016 peer conference is **Communicating testing during software development**.

> During DEWT6 we would like you to share with us your experiences in communicating about software testing while it is being developed. With whom did you share your test ideas and test results? How did you share it? How was your feedback received? Did it turn out the way you expected? Was it useful?

In my personal opinion, programmers, tester and others involved are all _developers_. With their combined efforts, a group of "developers" create a product or service. The only major difference between different developers is an area of expertise and thus their viewpoint. 

It was very interesting to see all of these different viewpoints engage in a discussion during the conference.
