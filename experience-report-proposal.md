# Communicating testing during software development.

Halfway through the year I changed jobs. I went from a company with a flagship product to a web agency.

This meant moving from an environment with (somewhat) clearly outlined processes to an environment that leaned mostly on heroic effort.

My experience report outlines the effort at my new employers company.
This includes, but is not limited to

- the ongoing struggle to get testers involved at an early stage of software development
- creating communication channels between teams and testers
- struggling with the ignorance about what testing is which value it adds to the process
